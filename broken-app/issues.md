# Broken App Issues

- Not using express.json() - express is not able to look for request body
- Generic handler "app.listen(3000)" is not written out
- error-handling middleware
- Not using expresserror.js - 404 error handling
- Inconsistant variable types > changing 'var'/'let' to 'const'
- Incomplete argument - Catch statement was not catching any errors
- Async callback function wasn't mapping asynchronously - pending promise
